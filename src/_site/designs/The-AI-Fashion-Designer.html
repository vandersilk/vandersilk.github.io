This design features prints of different fashion items (t-shirts, shoes, jackets, boots, handbags) that were “designed” by an AI fashion designer in two senses: the shape was produced by the algorithm, and the pattern that is printed on each item was determined by the famous “style transfer” technique.

The ideas used in this design have been presented/exhibited at White Night, Melbourne Knowledge Week, and the RMIT School of Fashion in 2018.
