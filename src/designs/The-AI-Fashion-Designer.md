<p>
This design features prints of different fashion items (t-shirts, shoes,
jackets, boots, handbags) that were "designed" by an AI fashion designer
in two senses: the shape was produced by the algorithm, and the pattern that
is printed on each item was determined by the famous "style transfer"
technique.
</p>

<p>
The ideas used in this design have been presented/exhibited at White Night,
    Melbourne Knowledge Week, and the RMIT School of Fashion in 2018.
